# Enhanced Automotive Requirements Extractor

## Overview

The **Enhanced Automotive Requirements Extractor** is a sophisticated Python-based tool built with Streamlit that automatically extracts, analyzes, and exports functional requirements from automotive specification documents (Word format). This tool is specifically designed for automotive industry professionals who need to process large specification documents and extract structured requirement data with high accuracy.

## üéØ Purpose

In the automotive industry, specification documents often contain hundreds or thousands of functional requirements scattered across multiple pages and sections. Manually extracting these requirements is:
- **Time-consuming**: Hours or days of manual work
- **Error-prone**: Easy to miss or misidentify requirements
- **Inconsistent**: Different team members may extract differently

This tool solves these problems by:
- Automatically identifying requirement IDs using configurable patterns
- Accurately mapping requirements to their source pages
- Organizing requirements by document sections
- Providing confidence scoring for extraction quality
- Enabling quick export to CSV/Excel for further processing

##  Key Features

### 1. **Accurate Page Mapping**
- Uses advanced algorithms to track page numbers in Word documents
- Detects explicit page breaks and section breaks
- Estimates pages based on content length when explicit breaks are absent
- Maps each requirement to its exact page number

### 2. **Section-Aware Extraction**
- Automatically identifies section headers (e.g., "Functional Requirements", "Non-Functional Requirements")
- Groups requirements by their containing sections
- Supports filtering by specific sections
- Recognizes multiple section naming conventions (English/French)

### 3. **Flexible Pattern Matching**
- Six pre-configured requirement ID patterns:
  - **WAVE5**: `WAVE5-AVAS-ST-FUNC-001`
  - **Generic Automotive**: `REQ-12345`
  - **Hierarchical**: `SYS-001-002-003`
  - **Standard Format**: `FUNC-REQ-001`
  - **Extended WAVE**: `WAVE5-ADVANCED-SYS-FUNC-001`
  - **Custom Pattern**: User-configurable patterns
- Multi-pattern selection for mixed document formats
- Case-insensitive matching

### 4. **Intelligent Table Processing**
- Extracts from structured requirement tables
- Handles multi-column layouts
- Identifies requirement IDs in any column
- Cleans and normalizes description text

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Confidence scoring for each extracted requirement
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Minimum confidence threshold filtering
- Validation of requirement structure

### 6. **Rich Analytics**
- Visual distribution of requirements by section
- Page-by-page requirement density
- Pattern usage statistics
- Confidence score distribution
- Summary metrics dashboard

### 7. **Flexible Export Options**
- **CSV Export**: Simple tabular format
- **Excel Export**: Multi-sheet workbook with sections
- Maintains all metadata (page, section, confidence)
- Ready for import into requirement management tools

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **EnhancedPageTracker**
```python
class EnhancedPageTracker:
```
- Tracks page numbers throughout the document
- Uses multiple strategies:
  - Explicit page break detection
  - Section break detection
  - Character-based estimation (2500 chars/page)
  - Line-based estimation (45 lines/page)
- Maps document elements to page numbers

#### 2. **SectionAwareExtractor**
```python
class SectionAwareExtractor:
```
- Main extraction engine
- Combines XML and document object processing
- Features:
  - Section header detection with regex patterns
  - Requirement ID extraction with multiple patterns
  - Table structure analysis
  - Description cleaning and normalization
  - Confidence calculation
  - Deduplication logic

#### 3. **Requirement Dataclass**
```python
@dataclass
class Requirement:
```
Stores extracted requirement information:
- `id`: Requirement identifier
- `description`: Requirement text
- `page`: Source page number
- `section`: Containing section name
- `table_index`: Table number in document
- `row_index`: Row number in table
- `confidence`: Extraction quality score (0-1)

## üîß Technical Details

### Document Processing Strategy

The tool uses a **dual-processing approach**:

1. **XML-Level Processing**
   - Accesses raw document XML structure
   - Precise page break detection
   - Direct element-to-page mapping
   - Handles complex table structures

2. **Document Object Processing**
   - Uses python-docx for high-level access
   - Paragraph and table iteration
   - Fallback for missed content
   - Cross-validation of results

### Pattern Matching

Requirement IDs are extracted using regex patterns:

```python
requirement_id_patterns = {
    'WAVE5': r'WAVE5[-_][A-Z]+[-_][A-Z]+[-_][A-Z]+[-_]\d+',
    'Generic Automotive': r'[A-Z]{2,8}[-_]\d{3,6}',
    # ... more patterns
}
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

```python
def _calculate_confidence(req_id, description):
    confidence = 1.0
    
    # Penalties
    if len(description) < 20: confidence *= 0.7
    if is_header_text(description): confidence *= 0.8
    
    # Bonuses
    if has_structured_id(req_id): confidence *= 1.1
    
    return min(confidence, 1.0)
```

### Deduplication

Requirements are deduplicated based on:
- Identical requirement IDs
- Similar description content (first 100 characters)
- Prevents double-counting from XML and docx processing
